# react-posts-chart

## Created App

This app is created with Vite + React , using yarn as a package manager.

## Steps

###### 1.Reading about the libraries

First step was to read documentation about the libraries that I have small to none experience with(Apollo, Visx).
Searching for different methods to achieve the end result with them.

###### 2.Fetching data

Second step was to figure it out how to fetch data with Apollo from the first time.Encountered some syntax errors due to my little experience with Appollo
but it wasn't a big problem fixed it pretty fast.

###### 3.Getting the dates

Right now i try to figure out how to manipulate the dates and convert,extract and use only the Months from the response data.
